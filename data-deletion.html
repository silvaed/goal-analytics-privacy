<h1>Goal Analytics - Data Deletion</h1>

<p>
Goal Analytics does not collect personally identifiable information such as 
name, email, address, or account login data.
</p>

<p>
The app may only store anonymous technical identifiers such as Firebase
analytics/session identifiers or notification tokens. These identifiers
cannot be linked to a real-world identity by the developer.
</p>

<p>
Because we do not store personal user accounts or identifiable personal
data, there is no personal data available to delete.
</p>

<p>
If you still wish to contact us regarding data, please email:<br>
<strong>footballstatsworld@gmail.com</strong>
</p>

<p>
Please include any relevant device or app information in your request. If we 
are able to locate any associated anonymous data, we will delete it.
